  <h2>Why Kaos Kuriosities?!</h2>

    <p>Well that is a 2 part question. The first part is Kaos was the nickname given to me when I was younger and a member of the Kaos Punx. I was the youngest member so I became little Kaos. Then I got bigger and it became just Kaos. Kuriosities is because that best describes how I came to know and expierence all of the thing I know and did. If I was curiouse about something I would seek it out and had to learn everything I could that involvrd it. So since this site and business is a culmination of all my expiriences and knowledge it only makes sense to name it as such, it was also my daughters idea so I had to run with it trust me you don't want on her bad side LOL!</p>

    <h3>So Why The Hell Can't This Guy Spell Things Right?!!</h3>

      <p>The spelling is on purpose. You see the punk rock crew I was part of spelt it that way, because it's an acronim that stands for Kids Against Our Society. The other part being miss spelled is just to give people fits so it's all for the fun of it!</p>

    <h4>More About Me!!!</h4>
      <p>So a little about me. I started running away from home at a young age and found I had many problems, turns out I have ADHD and bipolar. I started traveling around and took part in many things, like at the age of 18 I started a protest in my home town to get them to set up homeless youth services because there were none. We gave that county hell for six months and they finaly decided to get right and gave us the safe house that the kids needed. I have hitch hicked through every state accept Alaska and Hawii, It's a bit hard to thumb a ride to thoughs places trust me I got the briliant idea while I was stoned to take a case of beer and sit at the end of the runway trying to thumb a ride to Hawii, security was not amused LOL!! While traveling I had the chance to learn many useful skills and study many different religions and different social circles. I also saw many amazing, and some times terrifying, things. I have the Honor of being the Father of six amazing childre and now also a Papa to an equally amazing granddaughter. I came from a very large family so don't think the six kids is a huge feat my parents had eleven. Well there is not much else to say at this time, but if i think of it I will update this every so often and perhaps go into some more details about the things I;ve been through.</p>
