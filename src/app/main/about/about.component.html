  <h2>Who The Hell Is This Kaos Character?</h2>

    <p>Hi my name is Kaos, well that's not my real name. It is a knick name given to me many years ago, and rather fitting considering the life I have lived, and continue to live today. Why that name? well we will get into that later. Suffice it to say I have been the embodyment of Kaos. I started running away at a young age, and was always a difficult child. you see I had untreated ADHD, and so I was all over the place, some times quite literaly. I was always going from one skill to another as well as one hobby to another. you see I could never settle on one thing. I have a very high IQ, and I love to learn. I'm very good with my hands, that's what she said and don't ask which one because it was all of them LOL. So I have learned to do almost everything I've ever wanted to try, accept blacksmithing but I will get to that one here soon I hope. so in my 45 years of life I've done almost every type of construction, auto body, auto machancis, ranch hand, tattooing, body piercing, retail, food service, bouncer, driver, drug and alcohol counsoler, business owner, forman, and on and on. I do leather work, jewelry crafting, etchings, bead work, sculpting, drawing, airbrushing, electronics, that last one normaly would be in the first batch but i did it more as a hobby because I couldn't stay in one place for very long, but that list also goes on and on. I spent many years hitch hicking around the country allowing me to learn many different things and different styles of doing them. So this business is a culmination of all my expiriences, trials, and my sick twisted imagination, so enjoy!</p>

  <h3>Kaos? What's Up With The Damn Spelling?</h3>

    <p>So why the miss spelling of the word Kaos? Well you see many years ago I jioned a punk rock crew out of north hollywood named the KAOS punx which I was the youngest member of. Since I was the youngest they started calling me little Kaos. now to the why of the spelling. KAOS is an acronym that stand for Kids Against Our Society. Hence the name. The other miss spelled word is just for the fun of it, and screw you if you don't like it LOL!</p>
